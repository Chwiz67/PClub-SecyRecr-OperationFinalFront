## üîç Problem-Solving Approach

This section describes the strategy used in the `solve()` function to determine the minimum cost to traverse a graph, as inferred from the image.

### üß† Approach

The function models the traversal of a directed/undirected graph extracted from an image. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `pred(img_path)` returns:
     - $n$: Number of nodes.
     - $\text{adj} \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times n}$: Adjacency matrix of the graph.
   
2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - The traversal starts at node 0.
   - The goal is to reach node $n-1$ using **custom cost rules** depending on the **direction** of movement.

3. **Cost Model**:
   - The traversal keeps a **direction flag** $d \in \{0, 1\}$ and updates it based on edge orientation:
     - Forward edge $s \rightarrow i$:
       - If $d = 0$: cost += 1
       - If $d = 1$: cost += $n+1$
     - Backward edge $i \rightarrow s$:
       - If $d = 1$: cost += 1
       - If $d = 0$: cost += $n+1$
   
   - These transitions model a **penalty** for switching direction contextually.

4. **DFS with Backtracking**:
   - The algorithm performs a recursive **depth-first search**, tracking visited nodes to avoid cycles.
   - On reaching the destination node $n-1$, it appends the current path cost.
   - It backtracks to explore all valid paths and ultimately returns the minimum cost.

### üí° Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Memoization**:
   - Cache intermediate results using a state tuple $(s, d, \text{tuple}(vis))$ to avoid recomputation in overlapping subproblems.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Convert DFS to **BFS with priority queue** to naturally find the shortest path with the least cost early on.
   - This can help avoid computing all paths unnecessarily.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Introduce DP with state: dp[s][d][visited_mask] = min(cost)
   - Where `visited_mask` is a bitmask representation of visited nodes.

### ‚úÖ Summary

The current approach is exhaustive and guarantees correctness for small graphs. However, performance may degrade as $n$ increases due to redundant recursive paths. Adopting graph theory techniques like Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm with custom weights or memoized DFS would significantly improve efficiency.
